# ðŸŽ¯ useRef Playground â€” React Examples for Practical Reference Usage

This small React project demonstrates real-world use cases of the `useRef` hook and how it can be used in different scenarios â€” from accessing DOM elements to managing media playback, scroll animations, and performance-optimized state.

> Built as a hands-on learning tool for better understanding `useRef`, event-driven rendering, and non-render-triggering data storage in React.

## ðŸ“‚ Features Breakdown

Each section is separated with `#region` comments in the codebase to provide a modular learning experience.

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Accessing DOM Elements** | Using `useRef` to directly focus on an input element. |
| **Storing Mutable Values** | Holding a counter value that doesn't trigger a re-render. |
| **Stopwatch Logic** | Demonstrates timing using `setInterval`, with controlled re-renders via `useState`. |
| **Scroll-to-Element Animation** | Smoothly scrolls to an image in a list based on button clicks using DOM querying. |
| **Video Player Control** | Controls a video element using `play()` and `pause()` via ref. |
| **Passing Ref to Child** | Demonstrates how to access child component inputs using `ref`. |
