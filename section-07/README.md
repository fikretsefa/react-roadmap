# üéØ useReducer Playground ‚Äî React Examples for Practical Reference Usage

This React project demonstrates practical implementations of the `useReducer` hook through real-world examples like form handling, todo management, and state management patterns.

> Built as a hands-on learning tool for better understanding `useReducer`, state management, and complex state updates in React applications.

---

## üìÇ Features Breakdown

Each component demonstrates different aspects of `useReducer` implementation and state management patterns.

| Component | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Form Component** | Demonstrates basic form state management using `useReducer` with name and age fields. Shows how to handle input changes and state updates through actions. |
| **Todo Component** | A full-featured todo application showcasing complex state management with actions for adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos. |
| **Counter Component** | Simple counter implementation showing basic state updates and action handling with `useReducer`. |

## üí° Key Concepts

- **State Management**: Using `useReducer` for predictable state updates
- **Action Types**: Type-safe action definitions with TypeScript
- **Reducer Functions**: Pure functions for state transformations
- **Complex State Updates**: Handling nested state updates and multiple actions
